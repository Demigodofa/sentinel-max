# Agent Notes

## Orchestration pipeline
- Natural-language turns can bypass the legacy confirmation loop when `AUTO_MODE` is enabled. The `sentinel.orchestration.Orchestrator` runs tool calls automatically, publishes plan steps to the `plans` namespace, and asks for confirmation before destructive tools (`fs_delete`, `fs_write`, `pip_install`, `kill_process`).
- The plan publisher (`sentinel/orchestration/plan_publisher.py`) keeps the GUI Plan panel up to date. Update the plan steps' `status` and `note` fields to reflect queued/running/done/failed/awaiting_confirmation states.
- Post-run optimization persists alias drops and intent rules via `sentinel/orchestration/optimizer.py`; review `memory/tool_aliases.json` and `intent_rules.json` when adjusting tool schemas.
- GUI input now supports an injected command queue (`SentinelApp(..., injected_command_queue=...)`) so watchers like `sentinel/watchers/browser_command_relay.py` can feed `<START>...<STOP>` blocks from a ChatGPT tab straight into the controller without bypassing the GUI pipeline. The helper runner lives at `scripts/browser_chatgpt_relay.py`.
- The Windows launcher (`start_sentinel_max.bat`) starts the ChatGPT browser relay watcher by default when `START_BROWSER_RELAY` normalizes to `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`. The relay is Selenium-based (Chrome window + chromedriver on PATH) and now confirms the ChatGPT page loads before polling; extracted `<START>...<STOP>` blocks are injected into the GUI queue the same way as a user pressing Enter. Relay startup status is logged to `logs/launcher_last.log` and surfaces in a dedicated window, and the launcher prints the normalized flag plus the detected `chromedriver` path (or a not-found warning) to the console and log so missed Chrome windows can be debugged immediately. When chromedriver is missing the launcher skips the relay and logs the remediation instead of attempting to start a broken window. The relay process also logs a fatal error when driver creation fails so missing dependencies are explicit.

## Testing and docs
- New orchestration tests live in `sentinel/tests/test_orchestrator_plan_publishes.py`, `test_orchestrator_confirmation_gate.py`, and `test_optimizer_persists_rules.py`. Keep them passing when changing routing, plan publishing, confirmation gates, or optimizer behavior.
- Update this file and `README.md` whenever orchestration behavior, plan publishing semantics, or safety confirmations change.
